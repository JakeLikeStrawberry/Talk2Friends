  Note--> Pages where data is added and delete may need to be revisited in order to render changes

## Project 2.5 -- Sprint Improvements
1. Required Profile Information:

After initial registration and email validation, first-time users are directed to a page where they need to fill out all their personal information fields (name, age, affiliation, type) before they can proceed to the typical Meetings page.

2. User input is limited for their information such as name and affiliation so that it will not register over a certain length to prevent any potential user misuse

3. Users in meetings and friends lists are now shown by their names and not their emails

4. The recommended friends page now highlights users with purple that are international students
